# Utility LaTeX commands

This project holds a set of custom commands I heavily used in the past years, including utilities for exams.
- [irpagnossin-basic](./irpagnossin-basic/README.md) is a set o simple, yeat very useful, custom commands.
- [irpagnossin-exam](./irpagnossin-exam/README.md) is a package to create simple exams with answers and solutions, which can be optionally included in the output. I use this package a lot when teaching.

# Installation

Just execute the script `install.sh` or manually copy the files `.sty` and `.cfg` to some place where LaTeX can find them (follow installation file).

## TODO

- Conform to TeX Live Manager, [tlmgr](https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html).
